      <h1>A Learning Space</h1>
      <p>
        From my experience I have learned that the only thing which is constant
        is <i>Change</i>. And as this industry is very new relatively, there is
        still a huge scope of change. This tech Space will help you learn and
        adapt to the different changes in technologies and architectures.
      </p>
      <p>
        I feel in any language/subject/theory there are only <i>few</i> key
        concepts which we get after reading (many) books and browsing different
        sites. My idea is to list these key concepts at one place - the tech
        space.The concept can not be yours unless you apply it, so the next step
        is to apply those key concepts through assignments or exercises.
      </p>
      <p>
        So I will be adding different artcles in form of concepts and
        assignment. All the best and Happy Learning!!
      </p>
